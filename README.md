# Metameric Light

Contact: e.gecer@tue.nl

Abstract: Light does not only enable the visual system to perceive the outside world but also impacts humans via non-visual processes such as regulating the circadian system or inducing instantaneous changes in alertness and mood. To be able to understand and quantify effects of light on humans, we need sophisticated light designs that allow us to specifically target the 
desired photoreceptors. Experiments testing for effects of light on humanâ€™s physiological and psychological processes have the caveat of using visually distinguishable light that hamper blinding participants to the experimental conditions and disentangling visual and non-visual processes. Metameric lighting might offer a solution to this problem. In this paper, we are proposing an algorithmic approach using the principles of silent substitution and formulating it as an optimization problem to help researchers calculate metameric light pairs efficiently.

These are just examples of type of light conditions that can be produced, and the boundary conditions can be made as strict as needed such that it forces photoreceptors to be almost identically activated.
